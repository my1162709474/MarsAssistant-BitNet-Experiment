## Round 33: SIMD Gather & 64-bit Popcount Optimization

Actions taken:
1. Added hardware-accelerated SIMD gather for sigmoid LUT using _mm256_i32gather_ps
2. Added AVX-512 sigmoid version (16-wide processing)
3. Added matmul_1bit_64bit() using 64-bit popcount
4. Added HAS_AVX2_GATHER macro for feature detection
5. Fixed conditional compilation for AVX functions on ARM

Commit: 18ea9c4
Expected speedup: 1.3-2.0x (varies by platform)
Total optimizations: 128+
